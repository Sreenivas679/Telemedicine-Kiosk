 # 🏥 AI-Powered Telemedicine Kiosk (Prototype)  

## 📌 Overview  
Healthcare accessibility in rural India remains a critical challenge. This project introduces an **AI-driven telemedicine kiosk**, allowing users to **authenticate via biometrics**, report symptoms in their **preferred language**, and receive **AI-based symptom predictions**. The system aims to **bridge the healthcare gap** by providing an initial diagnosis before directing patients to medical professionals.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Multilingual Support**: Speech recognition API allows users to interact in their preferred language.  
- **AI-Based Symptom Prediction**: Utilizes **BERT and Naïve Bayes** models to assess symptoms and predict potential diseases.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **AI & ML**: BERT, Naïve Bayes, Scikit-learn  
- **Backend**: Flask, Python 3.11.4, SQL  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Speech Processing**: Google Speech-to-Text API  

## 🎯 Challenges & Considerations  
- **Handling multiple languages effectively** for broader accessibility.  
- **Ensuring high accuracy in symptom predictions** to minimize misdiagnosis.  
- **User-friendliness** for those unfamiliar with AI-driven systems.
