 # 🏥 AI-Powered Telemedicine-Kiosk (Prototype)  

## 📌 Overview  
Rural India lacks doctors, diagnostic facilities, and reliable internet. Existing telemedicine apps are hard to use due to language and literacy barriers. Patients delay treatment and depend on urban hospitals, causing overcrowding, higher costs, and widening the healthcare gap

## 🚀 Features  
- **Multilingual Support**: Speech recognition API allows users to interact in their preferred language.  
- **AI-Based Symptom Prediction**: Utilizes **BERT and Naïve Bayes** models to assess symptoms and predict potential diseases.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **AI & ML**: BERT, Naïve Bayes, Scikit-learn  
- **Backend**: Flask, Python 3.11.4, SQL  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Speech Processing**: Google Speech-to-Text API  

## 🎯 Challenges & Considerations  
- **Handling multiple languages effectively** for broader accessibility.  
- **Ensuring high accuracy in symptom predictions** to minimize misdiagnosis.  
- **User-friendliness** for those unfamiliar with AI-driven systems.
